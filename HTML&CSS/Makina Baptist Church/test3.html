                    <p>Makina Baptist Church began in <b>1987</b> as a common cell-group by <b>Missionary Lynn Raburn</b> 
                        and <b>Pastor James Muhanji</b> along Kabarnet road.</p>
                        <p>It later shifted to <b>Kibera,Makina</b> 
                        near <b>Kibera law courts</b> in <b>1988.</b></p>
                        <p>Unfortunately the Kibera Law Courts wanted to expound on its space and the church had already grown 
                        therefore it was allocated its current location in <b>Kichinjio Area</b> <i>
                        (it was called so because there was a cattle slaughter house by then)</i> 
                        by then<b> Chief Kosgei.</b></p>
